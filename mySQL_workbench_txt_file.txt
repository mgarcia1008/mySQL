1. Write the query to select all the names in the database. The columns should appear, even if there are no records in the database yet:
SELECT * 
FROM names
2. Insert your own name into the database!
INSERT INTO names (name, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ("Mindi", NOW(), NOW());
3. Insert another name or, NINJA BONUS: insert more than one name in a single statement.
INSERT INTO names (name, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ('Peter', NOW(), NOW());
4. Optional: Try creating, updating and deleting records using the statements you've learn about.
UPDATE names
SET name = 'Mickey'
WHERE id = 2;

DELETE FROM names
WHERE id = 2;
